An in-depth API documentation, including interactive code examples and extensive descriptions can be found at [marketstack.com/documentation](https://marketstack.com/documentation)

## Usage

**Initialize MarketstackService:**
```c#
    var options = Options.Create(new MarketstackOptions() { ApiToken = "apiToken"});
    var marketstackService = new MarketstackService(options, NullLogger<MarketstackService>.Instance);    
```

**GetExchanges:**
```c#
    var exchanges = await marketstackService.GetExchanges();
```

**GetExchangeStocks:**
```c#
    var nasdaqMic = "XNAS";
    var stocks = await marketstackService.GetExchangeStocks(nasdaqMic);
```    
    
**GetStockEodBars:**
```c#
    var appleSymbol = "AAPL";
    var fromDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-200);
    var toDate = DateTime.Now;
    var bars = await marketstackService.GetStockEodBars(appleSymbol, fromDate, toDate);      
```
**Parallel Requests:**

Parallel requests are supported using the [Throttling Libary](https://github.com/orshe4/Throttling) that allows limiting the number of requests per second.

```c#
    var options = Options.Create(new MarketstackOptions() { ApiToken = apiKey, MaxRequestsPerSecond = 3, Https = true });
    var marketstackService = new MarketstackService(options, NullLogger<MarketstackService>.Instance);
    List<string> symbols = new List<string>() { "AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOG", "VOD", "NVDA", "NFLX", "PEP", "NOW", "VEEV", "MOH" };
    var fromDate = new DateTime(2017, 9, 1);
    var toDate = DateTime.Now;
    var tasks = symbols.Select(async (symbol) => await marketstackService.GetStockEodBars(symbol, fromDate, toDate));
    var stocksBars = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
```

## Tests

Before running the tests, the ApiToken should be set using: 

```
setx ASPNETCORE_MarketstackApiToken {Your_Api_Token} /M
```
